fBMP version 0.97

This is a simple program that displays 256-color Win3 bitmaps in a PM window.
It uses the palette manager and probably won't work too well on systems that
don't have the palette manager (i.e., anything below OS/2 2.0 with CSD 6055).
It has been tested on ET4000 and XGA systems and works well with them.

This program is *not* really intended for end-users (though it should be
okay for them). Rather, I tried to write something that PM programmers could
build upon to make better viewers.

(Why does it view Win3 bitmaps and not OS/2 bitmaps? It was easier for
me to get the docs for the Win3 format and sample Win3 bitmaps. If someone
modifies the program to read OS/2 bitmaps, I'd like to hear from them.)

The "syntax" for invoking fBMP is

   FBMP filename

The filename is required and must specify a Win3 bitmap file. You need not
include the .BMP extension.

If something goes wrong, the program will beep and return you to the OS/2
prompt. Specifically:

1 beep: File cannot be opened (or you didn't specify a file).
2 beeps: File is not a Win3 bitmap.
3 beeps: Cannot allocate enough memory space to read bitmap file. (I haven't
   seen this happen yet -- ain't virtual memory great?)

Again, this is *not* intended to be an efficient or fast BMP viewer;
only one that can be easily understood and improved. I'd appreciate
hearing from anyone who makes improvements. You can contact me at
sthiagar@bronze.ucs.indiana.edu on the internet, or 72175,12 on
compuserve. Note that I read my internet mail almost every day, but
only check into compuserve about once a week. Thanks to Peter Nielsen
(pnielsen@aton.abo.fi) for some clever ideas and significant
improvements he made to this program.
